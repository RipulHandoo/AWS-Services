## Introduction

Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service offered by AWS. It allows you to store and retrieve data of various types, including text, images, videos, and more. This repository serves as a guide to help you perform common operations with S3 buckets using AWS SDKs or AWS CLI commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using the examples in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: To run AWS CLI commands, you must have it installed and configured with the necessary credentials. You can install and configure the AWS CLI by following the [official AWS CLI documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

- **AWS SDKs**: If you prefer to use programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript, you can use AWS SDKs to interact with S3. Ensure you have the SDK of your choice installed and configured with AWS credentials.
